[Live demo](https://wobbly-matrix.chrisvilches.com/)

## What is this?

A geometric algorithm inspired by Ubuntu's wobbly windows.

## How to use

Clone the repository, then execute:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This starts the development server.

Build the production distribution with:

```
npm run build
```

## Future work

### Image mapping

Map the matrix to an image and perform transformations to make the image wobble.

For example: https://open.gl/transformations
